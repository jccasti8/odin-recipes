# odin-recipes

A Recipe webpage written all in HTML (atleast for now), with multiple recipes all linked in the home page.
Skills demonstrated in this project have been the html boilerplate, learned how to use lists, links, add images and diffenrent forms of texts in html. And navigating through git using the command line has been huge.
